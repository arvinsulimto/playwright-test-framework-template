Feature: Login to Sauce Demo
    As a user
    I want to login to Sauce Demo
    So that I can access the application

    Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
        Given I am on the login page
        When I login with username "standard_user" and password "secret_sauce"
        Then I should be logged in successfully

    Scenario: Failed login with invalid credentials
        Given I am on the login page
        When I login with username "invalid_user" and password "invalid_password"
        Then I should see an error message "Epic sadface: Username and password do not match any user in this service"

    Scenario: Failed login with locked out user
        Given I am on the login page
        When I login with username "locked_out_user" and password "secret_sauce"
        Then I should see an error message "Epic sadface: Sorry, this user has been locked out."
